## Recipes Odin Project

In this project I'll be creating a Web Page with 3 types of recipes. This project will be revist in the future to add some styling with CSS.

The recipes are Ramen, Soba and Takoyaki. Japanese Cuisine that now you can enjoy too with this great recipes. I really suggest you give them a try. がんばれ!
