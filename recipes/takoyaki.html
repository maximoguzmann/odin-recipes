        <h2>Takoyaki</h2>
        <p>
          Takoyaki is a beloved Japanese street food — crispy on the outside,
          soft and gooey inside, filled with tender octopus pieces! Topped with
          savory sauce, mayo, and bonito flakes, every bite bursts with flavor
          and fun!

      <!-- How To -->

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>To Prepare the Filling:</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Grind ¼ cup katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes) into a fine
                powder. Set aside to use during cooking.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cut 2 green onions/scallions into thin slices and mince 1 Tbsp
                pickled red ginger (beni shoga or kizami beni shoga). Cut 4.2 oz
                octopus sashimi (boiled octopus) into bite-sized pieces about ½
                inch (1.3 cm); I use the rangiri cutting technique.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>To Make the Batter:</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Combine 1 cup all-purpose flour (plain flour), 2 tsp baking
                powder, and ½ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt in a large mixing
                bowl. Whisk it all together.
              </li>
              <li>
                Add 2 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell), 1 tsp soy sauce, and 1½
                cups dashi (Japanese soup stock) to the bowl.
              </li>
              <li>
                Whisk until well blended. Transfer it to a handled measuring cup
                or any pitcher with a spout for easy pouring.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>To Cook the Takoyaki:</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Heat the takoyaki pan to 400ºF (200ºC) over medium heat. Use a
                brush to generously grease the rounded chambers and flat top
                surface with 2 Tbsp neutral oil. When the oil starts to smoke,
                pour the batter to fill the chambers. It's okay to slightly
                overfill the cavities. In the next steps, the batter will likely
                overflow as you add more ingredients to it.
              </li>
              <li>
                Add 1-3 octopus pieces, depending on their size, to each chamber
                and sprinkle the ground katsuobushi powder on top.
              </li>
              <li>
                Sprinkle ⅓ cup tenkasu/agedama (tempura scraps), the green onion
                slices, and the chopped pickled red ginger on top. After 3
                minutes or so, when the batter on the bottom has set and is
                slightly crisp, use skewers to break the connected batter on top
                between the chambers. Rotate each piece 90 degrees (a quarter
                turn) toward the bottom of the pan. Stuff the connected dough
                back into the ball as you turn; the uncooked batter will flow
                out from inside to create another side of the ball. After you
                finish turning them, set a timer for 4 minutes.
              </li>
              <li>
                After 4 minutes, rotate them again, starting with the first
                ball. Turn each takoyaki another 90 degrees toward the bottom of
                the pan so the remaining uncooked batter pours out into the
                chamber to complete the ball shape. Home takoyaki griddles don't
                distribute heat evenly, so it's a good idea to swap the balls
                around to different chambers so they brown evenly. After turning
                and cooking for another 4 minutes, they are done.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>To Serve:</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Transfer them onto a plate and drizzle with ½ cup takoyaki sauce
                and Japanese Kewpie mayonnaise. Sprinkle with katsuobushi (dried
                bonito flakes) and aonori (dried green laver seaweed) and serve
                with a side of pickled red ginger (beni shoga or kizami beni
                shoga). Serve immediately. (But, be careful—they're VERY hot
                inside!)
